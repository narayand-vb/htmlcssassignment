                <p><span class="sub-title">Team Size : </span>4</p>
                <p><span class="sub-title">Challenges : </span>It was showing highest accuracy of svm but not giving the right
                    result. So we removed SVM model and add Random Forest and then it stated giving us right results.</p>
                <p><span class="sub-title">Description : </span>Technology used was : <em>Machine learning using
                        python, Used Data Set was downloaded from Kaggle.</em><br>When people input their details which were asked in that project then the project
                    predict the chance of diabates in that person. The result will be 0 or 1. 0 means low chance of diabates and 1 means high chance of diabates. May be some result can differ as it was 80:20 means 80% of result will be right and 20% may not give exact result.
                    My Role in this project was to write code until data visualization , some documentation part and prepared all the PPT. I was also team learder so managing and submission part was also done by me.
